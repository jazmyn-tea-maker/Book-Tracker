To do:
- Make searched books addable
- Edit button
    ^ Click event brings up the new book Ui, but different. It's connected to that books object, brings the properties into the inputs.
- Delete Button
- Favorite button - Puts tag on book. (Or book in tag, more accurately.)
- Tag Editor
- Tag Organizing. (Make button specifically for tags, when user clicks category, book container fills only with those books.)
        ^^ Pull from the actual tag arrays instead of the 'Allbooks' array.
- Put Down button
- If the book container is empty: 'Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.' - Eckhart Tolle
- Save the person's info into cache. (Maybe attach it to google account, like the others?)
- Make options dropdown
- Progress bar at bottom of book hover
